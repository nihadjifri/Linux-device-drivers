make sure both the "driver.c" file and "Makefile" is available in the current directory:

check current kernel version:

>>  uname -r
>>  4.9.80-v7+

check softlink built is available at : /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build 

Then only we can "make" our module(LKM) successfully

Check kernel header files available in :
/usr/src/`uname -r`

If not :
add the kernel header files to compile your kernel module
sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers

First remove local apt cache by doing "apt-get clean", and then try your "apt-get install" again.

Note however, if your archives got corrupted in the first place, your SDcard might be low quality or broken (or fake),
so you might want to check that too if problems persists (running fsck, checking SDcard with F3 or similar)
