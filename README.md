Hi all, welcome to the awesome world of linux deviece drivers. This tutorial is for absolute bigginers who are passionate and excited to step into device driver programming and kernel hacking.

Skills Required:
 I assume you have basic understading on the various linux modules like process management,file management etc, and a basic knowledge on linux kernel. you dont want to be extremely good in those.
Hardware Requirements:
	You need a machine [PC,laptop, raspberry pi, Beagle board] of any manufacturer of any version which can run any distribution of linux on it. I recomment you to work with out any virtual machines like vmware or virtual box, its better to work on pure hardware with single linux distribution or a dual booted machine.
	Here i would like to give you all the required information as n number of capsules each containg the most importand concepts and steps to be followed while we deal with it. So for each modules, i have added a README file go through it first to understand the concepts and try to follow the steps, run the code see the output compare it with the provided output. if its clear you are done or if you have any doubt comment it below, i'll reach you back as soon as possible. If you wanna get more information on that go to the material folder and find the pdf books and links read those it will turn you out to an advanced level kernel hacker.
	Now its always a good practice to know about the working of github, how to play around with it. without any doubt its a killer in project management where if you are a team and if you want to collaborate multiple people from different places to the same project and you want to keep track of the differnt versions of you project git is one of the best for you.
	So go thorugh the gitcommands.txt [only for git - not for linux driver] file to get in touch with the git commands so that you can work with git from your command line. If you are in any of the linux distribution you can use your basic terminal application or if you are a windows user recomend you to download the application from the link provided below:

when ever we write any module we should follow a cirtain coding style, check out the link below for a better understanding:

So with out any further delay lets get started.
